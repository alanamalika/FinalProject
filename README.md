# Research Question
How has MoMa’s acquisition reflect their commitment to diversity in the arts?
# Why?
I used to work for a Southeast Asian art media platform which gave me the opportunity to interview artists, liaise with galleries, and manage social media promotion in the industry. It was clear to me while I was working in Jakarta that there was no shortage of compelling artists, cultural narratives, and art movements within the region. However, it was rare that I found representation of Southeast Asian art beyond the local scene. This data is important to me and others because MoMa is a prominent global art institution, recognition of diverse artists through acquisitions is important to budding art ecosystems like Southeast Asia because it puts the spotlight on other artists in the region as well. Without accessible data and visualizations, museums cannot be held accountable to curate collections that truly reflect the contents of the industry.
# Description of Data Sources
This research data source contains two data sets:
**Artwork catalog:** Spanning 138,151 records, this data includes every work that have been accessioned into MoMA’s collection and cataloged to the museum’s database. It catalogs basic metadata for each work including title, artist, date made, medium, dimensions, and date acquired by the Museum.
**Artist catalog:** Spanning 15,222 records, this data includes every artist whose work has been acquired in MoMA's collection and has been cataloged to the museum’s database. It catalogs basic metadata for each artist, including name, nationality, gender, birth year, death year, Wiki QID, and Getty ULAN ID.

# Scope
For this project I hope the scope of my analysis and visualizations will cover three broad themes:

**Diversity over time:**
- Analysis of acquired artwork metadata per year based on medium, nationality, and gender.
- Investigating annual trends on whether artworks are acquired within their lifetime.

**Acquisition by region:**
- Regional analysis of artist metadata
- Pie chart presenting the percentages of artworks in the database representing each continent.
- Age distribution of artists from the same region.
 
**Top 10s:**
- In depth text analysis from external resources into the top 10 artists representing minority groups (e.g. female artists, Asian artists, LGBTQIA+ artists).
- A concluding paragraph of what insights you expect to gain from your research.
# Conclusion
"At The Museum of Modern Art and MoMA PS1, we celebrate creativity, openness, tolerance, and generosity. We aim to be inclusive places— both onsite and online—where diverse cultural, artistic, social, and political positions are welcome. We’re committed to sharing the most thought-provoking modern and contemporary art, and hope you will join us in exploring the art, ideas, and issues of our time."
While vital for public education, museums remain a controversial space because many prominent collections acquire pieces through without proper practices (e.g. presenting items looted from former colonies). As part of an effort to transform museum spaces, it is essential to create inclusivity. As one of the most recognizable art institutions is the world, MoMa is at the forefront of this effort. Threfore, I hope that this project can investigate and present whether MoMa's acquisitions reflect their mission create "inclusive places."
